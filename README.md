NASA Rover image fetcher cli

This is a simple cli app
You don't have to provide flags, but if you wish to, the following are allowed:
--days - number of days since right now, your local time. eg. --days 5
--rover - name of the rover, default is curiosity (probably the only one still outputing images). eg. --rover curiosity
--api_key - your api key, also could probably go with demo key here, which is default.
